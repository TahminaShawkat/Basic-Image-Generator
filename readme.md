# Basic Image Generator

Basic Image Generator is a beginner level Python project. The system asks users to select options from categories individually. Three categories have been designed for this application and each one has a list of pictures that are pre stored in the database. Google Drive is used in this project to store those pictures or databases. 
After selecting the desired image, the user can apply some color and effects as per program requirement. 
Five types of color and three different effect options are available for users. These options are defined in multiple functions in the project.example:def blue(img1):. Users can play around with these colors and effects. 
At the end the program will ask the user whether to continue playing with the app or not. User preference will proceed the application to the next step.
A report will be generated asking for feedback and that will be stored in a text file.
However this is a beginner level Python project, I am planning to implement more arts and effects and make more user friendly applications for the future.
